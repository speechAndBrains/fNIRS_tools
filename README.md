Scripts for MVPA of fNIRS

Unfortunately, this repository is not supported.  It has been shared for transparency rather than as a tool for general use. If you choose to use these scripts, then you do so at your own risk.  We have road tested these scripts within limits of our resources and the needs for of the projects for which it has been used.  

Note that the scripts implement correlation based and SVM based classification. The correlation based pipeline has been much less well tested and the functionality is not fully developed as this was not needed for the projects that we used these scripts for.

You may also be interested in the toolbox developed by Lauren Emberson and colleagues which was originally developed with the intention of being used more broadly by the neuroimaging community: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172500
